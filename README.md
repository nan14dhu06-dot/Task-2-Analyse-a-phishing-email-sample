Phishing Email Analysis – Cyber Security Internship (Task 2)

📌 Objective
Analyze a suspicious email sample to identify phishing characteristics, spoofing indicators, header inconsistencies, and malicious elements.

🛠 Tools Used
Email client / text version of email
Free online Header Analyzer
Browser developer tools (optional)

📝 Steps Performed
-Collected a phishing email sample.
-Examined the sender’s email address for spoofing.
-Analyzed email headers using a header analyzer tool.
